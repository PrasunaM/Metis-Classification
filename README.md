The aim of this project is to make weather more predictable and understand the main indicators of the rain. Data was obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/jsphyg/weather-dataset-rattle-package) which 10 year weather data. 

An accuracy of 0.83 was obtained utilizing Random Forest.

# Conclusion

Feature importance from Logistic regression and Random Forest revealed that Humidity at 3PM the day before influences if it is going to rain the next day.
